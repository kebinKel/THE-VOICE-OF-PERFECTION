The world today is in crises. These are the days of
 mourning. More than ever the world is bedeviled with
  intractable problems. Humankind is in search of solutions
   to her seemingly insurmountable problems. Men are 
   yearning for the return of a Saviour. Believers of 
   different congregations and faiths are groaning in 
   utter and palpable grief, praying for a consolation
    in a world beset with horrific and terrifying 
    circumstances. We are in a difficult season and this
     period is crucial because Yahweh is separating the 
     just from the unjust. While the prevailing conditions
      may continue to appear inexplicable to many, even
       some who consider themselves religious will be 
       shaken. Is there any hope for this state of 
       hopelessness and misery in the world? Today, 
       The Voice of Perfection is Revealed. It is the
        word of the good shepherd. This written word 
        gives life. It offers a solution to all who 
        understand the times and season. The Earth is hot.
         Many lives have being turned upside down s
         piritually. There is weeping and wailing and 
         gnashing of teeth. So many desire a relief from
          the cooling waters of life. That is why the 
          message Revealed in The Voice of Perfection is
           timely. Here a sheep of the good shepherd comes
            to the brethren unannounced with the revelation
             and word of Yahweh proclaiming the sole 
             authority of the Master Jesus, who is 
             Yahoshea. Today the Messiah speaks again 
             in fulfilment of scripture in John 10:16.
              The word today is provable. When we practice
               living by the word. Yahweh puts an end to 
               this day of
 mourning, bringing healing to our minds and bodies.

        This record is a true literature of life. This great story of life is centred on Yahweh and Yahoshea (Jesus). The servant of Yahweh in The Message of Yahweh Today comes to you unannounced. He is hopeful of what the future holds for the flock of Yahweh (The third flock). The Messiah Yahoshea (Christ Jesus) works, even as Yahweh continues to work in the midst of His people in the world to bring into fulfillment His plans for the sheep fold. 

The servant of Yahweh, the Pathman, hears THE VOICE OF PERFECTION. This voice – THE VOICE OF PERFECTION will speak to all men in righteousness. It is for this reason, that The Message of Yahweh Today is proclaimed from one nation to the other. 

This is the commission; I have received from Yahweh to deliver the light and form of Yahweh to the peoples of the world. This is just the beginning. 

This revelation - Word Written by Pathman is provable by all those who seek after righteousness. The proof of every true word, is the power of its word to save, purify and transform lives. Opening up the eyes of the blind, ears of the deaf and conferring everlasting peace to all who belong to this flock. 

What story, will I tell the world about this servant and what would I consider an achievement. Nothing in the world deserves glory or glorification. Yahweh has prepared the servant for a mission to live by His word and proclaim His word, so that all men can partake in Yahweh’s great feast of righteousness. 

I have achieved nothing outside His will. We can only consider ourselves, achievers once Yahweh’s peace abides in us.

Like I mentioned earlier. This story is not about a man. It is about Yahweh and Yahoshea (Jesus) and about the flock today, for which we are all brethren under the leadership of the good shepherd. Blessed be the name of Yahweh.
